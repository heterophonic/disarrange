            Tamara Hardesty, soprano, has been described by noted New York Times music critic James R. Oestreich as "...a particular joy, singing with a clear, agile soprano and spinning out the coloratura with ease." In addition, Andrew Porter wrote in the New Yorker magazine that Hardesty "...gave pleasure in many gentle, fluent, well-shaped passages."
