            Heather Green is an international vocal artist, born on a farm in Pennsylvania, USA, now living in Berlin, Germany. In the 2021/22 season, Green joins the Berliner Staatsoper for the new production of SLEEPLESS, by Petr E&ouml;tv&ouml;s, debuting November 28, 2021. In the Spring of 2022, Green will appear in Wagner's TANNH&Auml;USER, with Hudson Festival Theater, New York; she will also revisit her partnership with People in Rooms for the development of ALLKILLER, a filmic event based on the music of Wagner's Br&uuml;nnhilde.

            Equally active in traditionally stages works and modern Avant-garde productions, in previous seasons Green has been heralded for her portrayal of Richard Strauss’s Salome, with West Bay Opera in Palo Alto, CA (2017), the Black Orchid Theater in New York (2018), and in a modern adaptation - Ausser sich/ Salome - with People in Rooms in Berlin, Germany (2019). Green has been described as: “a dynamic Salome, with a voice up to the challenge of this demanding role. Her performance is fearless, as is her singing” - R. Batti, Almanac, and as a: “silken soprano with a big sound and luscious top notes.” - A. Broner, Repeat Performances. Of a 2018 revisitation of the role, with black orchid theater, critic Jan Ewing wrote: “Ms. Green has a fine, strong voice, with an amazing vocal range, capable of shaking the walls when necessary, but also able to produce lovely pianissimos and amazing low notes that would make any baritone jealous.”
