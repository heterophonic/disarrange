            Composer, Luis Andrei Cobo, a native of New York City, has had a passion for music since he saw the movie Star Wars at age 4, which was also when he started taking piano lessons. Following a deep and abiding love of film scores, Cobo has been composing music since the age of 12. Having written music for a variety of media including a number of orchestral works, his passion lies heavily in setting poetry to music. In 1990 he was admitted to Manhattan School of Music as a composition student and won the Absolut Vodka Composers Award. Completing both his B.M and M.M., he studied with David Noon, Aaron Jay Kernis, Richard Danielpour and Giampaolo Bracali (whose sudden passing in 2006 inspired the work <b className="goldenrod">The Disarrange</b>, for Soprano, Cello and Piano with poetry of Jennifer Michael Hecht which was performed at his memorial concert in NYC), and gained a profound understanding of technology while studying electronic music with the late Elias Tanenbaum.

            In 1996 Cobo was the recipient of the Concert Artistâ€™s Guild Composers Award, which resulted in the commissioning of three chamber works: Prelude and Millennium for Oboe and String Quartet, Postlude for Baritone, Flute, Cello and Piano, and Personal Demons for piano trio. In 2005, he accidentally discovered the poetry of Jennifer Michael Hecht while searching for new poets online and has since set 5 of her poems, three of which are on this album.

            In 2017, in collaboration with pianist Tamami Honma and the Cambrian Symphony Orchestra, a piano concerto was born which went on to garner two 'Best of the Bay' awards for new music for that season. Subsequent collaborations with Tamami Honma have yielded several short piano works and a song cycle which was premiered by the Cal Arte Ensemble and soprano Heather Green, all of which are featured on this album!

            Since 1991, Luis Andrei Cobo has enjoyed numerous collaborations with soprano Tamara Hardesty. This album is the culmination of 30 years of collaborative effort and is the first such compilation commemorating their fruitful professional relationship.

            Current projects include a large aria for Heather Green on her poetry which is part of a larger symphonic work, and two more songs for Tamara Hardesty on the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.
