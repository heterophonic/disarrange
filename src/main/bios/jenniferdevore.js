            Jennifer DeVore earned her BA in art history at Harvard before earning her Masters degree from the New England Conservatory.  Hailed as “superb” by the New York Times, she has appeared at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center and London’s Barbican Center. A review of her violin/cello duo’s recent debut album “Zentripetal” mentions her “suave phrasing, impeccable intonation and effortless control.” DeVore has worked closely with composers John Cage, John Zorn, Daniel Bernard Roumain and Ornette Coleman, and has played in the Bang-On-A-Can Marathon and on WNYC’s New Sounds. Her newest string quartet project, SEVEN)SUNS, is breaking new ground in both classical and metal/hardcore worlds. The group was featured on the legendary hardcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan’s final album and played their last show. Other groups she has played with include the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, the Jose Limon Dance Company, FLUX Quartet and Sweet Plantain Quartet. Her diverse interests have led to recordings and performances with artists such as Il Divo, Alicia Keyes, DJ Spooky, Josh Groban, Suzanne Vega, Jay-Z, Pink Martini, Laura Branigan, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra as well as many bands in New York. DeVore is a member of the Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra and teaches at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn.
